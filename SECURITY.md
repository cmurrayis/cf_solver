- ✅ **Follow responsible disclosure for any findings**
- ✅ **Comply with applicable laws and regulations**

- ❌ **Do not use for unauthorized access**
- ❌ **Do not overwhelm target systems**
- ❌ **Do not violate terms of service**
- ❌ **Do not use for malicious purposes**

### Secure Configuration

#### Recommended Security Settings

```python
# Security-focused configuration
from cloudflare_research import CloudflareBypassConfig

config = CloudflareBypassConfig(
    # Limit resource usage
    max_concurrent_requests=50,  # Reasonable limit
    requests_per_second=5.0,     # Conservative rate
    timeout=30.0,                # Prevent hanging requests

    # Minimize data retention
    session_persistence=False,   # Disable persistent sessions
    detailed_logging=False,      # Reduce log data

    # Network security
    verify_ssl=True,            # Always verify certificates
    max_redirects=5,            # Limit redirect chains

    # JavaScript execution limits
    javascript_timeout=10.0,    # Limit execution time
    challenge_timeout=30.0      # Overall challenge timeout
)
```

#### Environment Hardening

```bash
# Create isolated environment
python -m venv cloudflare_research_env
source cloudflare_research_env/bin/activate

# Install with integrity verification
pip install --require-hashes -r requirements.txt

# Set restrictive permissions
chmod 700 cloudflare_research_env/
```

#### Network Isolation

```python
# Use with network proxies or controls
config = CloudflareBypassConfig(
    proxy="http://security-proxy:8080",
    dns_servers=["your-secure-dns-server"],
    bind_address="127.0.0.1"  # Bind to localhost only
)
```

### Deployment Security

#### Production Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Use dedicated service account with minimal permissions
- [ ] Deploy in isolated network environment
- [ ] Enable comprehensive logging and monitoring
- [ ] Implement rate limiting at network level
- [ ] Regular security updates and patches
- [ ] Audit trails for all testing activities

#### Docker Security Configuration

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml security settings
version: '3.8'
services:
  cloudflare-bypass:
    build: .
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
    read_only: true
    user: nobody
    cap_drop:
      - ALL
    networks:
      - isolated_network
    tmpfs:
      - /tmp:noexec,nosuid,size=100m
    environment:
      - CF_BYPASS_LOG_LEVEL=INFO
      - CF_BYPASS_MAX_CONCURRENT=10
```

#### Monitoring and Alerting

```python
# Security monitoring configuration
import logging
import os

# Configure security logging
security_logger = logging.getLogger("cloudflare_research.security")
security_handler = logging.FileHandler(
    os.path.join("/var/log", "cloudflare_research_security.log")
)
security_formatter = logging.Formatter(
    '%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
)
security_handler.setFormatter(security_formatter)
security_logger.addHandler(security_handler)
security_logger.setLevel(logging.WARNING)

# Example security event logging
security_logger.warning(f"High request rate detected: {rate} RPS")
security_logger.error(f"JavaScript execution timeout: {challenge_data}")
security_logger.critical(f"Potential SSRF attempt: {target_url}")
```

## Security Features

### Built-in Protections

The tool includes several security features:
