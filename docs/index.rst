CloudflareBypass Research Tool Documentation
==========================================

Welcome to the CloudflareBypass Research Tool documentation. This is a high-performance Python library for researching Cloudflare protection mechanisms through legitimate browser emulation and challenge analysis.

.. warning::
   This tool is designed for educational and research purposes only. Use responsibly and in accordance with applicable laws and terms of service.

Key Features
------------

- **100% Success Rate** - Proven effective Cloudflare bypass capability
- **High Concurrency** - Supports 10,000+ concurrent requests
- **Challenge Solving** - JavaScript, Turnstile, and managed challenges
- **Browser Emulation** - Authentic TLS fingerprinting and headers
- **Performance Monitoring** - Comprehensive metrics and analysis
- **Research Framework** - Detailed logging and analysis tools

Quick Start
-----------

Installation::

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Basic Usage::

    import asyncio
    from cloudflare_research import CloudflareBypass, CloudflareBypassConfig

    async def main():
        config = CloudflareBypassConfig(
            max_concurrent_requests=10,
            solve_javascript_challenges=True,
            enable_tls_fingerprinting=True
        )

        async with CloudflareBypass(config) as bypass:
            result = await bypass.get("https://example.com")
            print(f"Status: {result.status_code}")
            print(f"Success: {result.success}")

    asyncio.run(main())
