# Feature Specification: High-Performance Browser Emulation Research Tool

**Feature Branch**: `002-specify-txt`
**Created**: 2025-01-17
**Status**: Ready for Planning
**Input**: User description: "@specify.txt"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a security researcher or performance engineer, I need a tool that accurately emulates browser behavior when accessing web resources protected by advanced security services, so that I can test and analyze my own infrastructure's performance, security configurations, and user experience under various load conditions in a controlled research environment.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a researcher has deployed Cloudflare protection on their test infrastructure, **When** they use the research tool to access their protected endpoints, **Then** the tool accurately emulates Chrome browser behavior and provides detailed metrics about the interaction
2. **Given** a performance engineer needs to test system capacity, **When** they initiate multiple concurrent test requests to their infrastructure, **Then** the tool handles thousands of simultaneous connections without performance degradation
3. **Given** a QA team needs to validate security challenge configurations, **When** they encounter different types of challenges on their test sites, **Then** the tool detects, reports, and handles each challenge type appropriately
4. **Given** a researcher needs to analyze request patterns, **When** they export data from testing sessions, **Then** the tool provides comprehensive metrics and logs suitable for analysis

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the target infrastructure becomes overloaded during testing?
- How does the system handle rate limiting imposed by the tested infrastructure?
- What occurs when network connectivity is interrupted during a large batch test?
- How does the tool respond to unexpected challenge types or security configurations?
- What happens when resource limits are reached on the testing machine?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accurately emulate Chrome browser networking behavior for research purposes
- **FR-002**: System MUST support 10,000+ concurrent test connections without performance degradation
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide a module interface that can be integrated into existing research tools
- **FR-004**: System MUST operate in a stateless manner where each test request is independent
- **FR-005**: System MUST detect and report different types of security challenges encountered during testing
- **FR-006**: System MUST include usage restrictions to ensure ethical research practices (configurable rate limiting, domain whitelist support, and educational/research use notices)
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide detailed performance metrics for each test request
- **FR-008**: System MUST support batch testing of multiple endpoints simultaneously
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain consistent browser fingerprint throughout test sessions
- **FR-010**: System MUST allow export of test results and metrics in JSON format for programmatic analysis, with optional CSV export for spreadsheet tools
- **FR-011**: System MUST prevent resource exhaustion on the testing infrastructure (memory usage under 100MB per 1000 concurrent requests, automatic backpressure at 80% resource utilization)
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide rate limiting capabilities to prevent overwhelming tested infrastructure
- **FR-013**: Users MUST be able to configure test parameters including concurrency levels and request patterns
- **FR-014**: System MUST log all test activities for audit and analysis purposes
- **FR-015**: System MUST comply with research ethics and legal requirements (honor robots.txt, include clear research/educational purpose notices, require explicit consent flag for production URLs)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Test Request**: Represents a single browser emulation request with URL, configuration, and timing data
- **Test Session**: Collection of related test requests with shared configuration and metrics
- **Challenge Record**: Information about security challenges encountered during testing
- **Performance Metrics**: Timing, throughput, and resource usage measurements from test runs
- **Test Configuration**: Settings controlling browser emulation behavior and test parameters
