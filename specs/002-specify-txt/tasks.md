# Tasks: High-Performance Browser Emulation Research Tool

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-specify-txt/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   → Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: Each file → contract test task
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: models, services, CLI commands
   → Integration: DB, middleware, logging
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests?
   → All entities have models?
   → All endpoints implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Dependencies

### Critical Path
- Setup (T001-T004) → Tests (T005-T016) → Models (T017-T022) → Foundation (T023-T030) → Integration (T045-T048) → Polish (T065-T070)

### Module Dependencies
- T045 (CloudflareBypass) blocks by: T023-T030 (TLS/HTTP), T035-T039 (challenges), T031-T034 (browser)
- T047 (session mgmt) blocked by: T017-T022 (models), T045 (main class)
- T048 (metrics) blocked by: T020 (PerformanceMetrics model), T041 (performance utils)

### Testing Dependencies
- Contract tests (T005-T011) must fail before any implementation
- Integration tests (T012-T016) after core models (T017-T022)
- Unit tests (T059-T064) after respective components

```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies between them
- Verify all contract and integration tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each major phase completion
- Use uvloop for production deployments (mentioned in setup)
- Focus on async/await patterns throughout implementation
- Target 10,000+ concurrent requests capability
- Memory usage must stay under 100MB per 1000 requests

## Task Generation Rules
*Applied during main() execution*

1. **From Contracts**:
   - cloudflare_bypass_api.yaml → 7 contract test tasks [P]
   - python_module_interface.py → Core interface validation

2. **From Data Model**:
   - 5 entities → 5 model creation tasks [P]
   - Relationships → session and metrics integration

3. **From User Stories (quickstart)**:
   - 5 test scenarios → 5 integration tests [P]
   - Performance benchmarks → stress testing tasks

4. **From Research Decisions**:
   - curl_cffi + tls-client → TLS fingerprinting tasks
   - uvloop + aiohttp → HTTP client tasks
   - PyMiniRacer → JavaScript challenge solver
   - Semaphore patterns → concurrency utilities
