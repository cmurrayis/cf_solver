# Implementation Plan: High-Performance Browser Emulation Research Tool

**Branch**: `002-specify-txt` | **Date**: 2025-01-17 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-specify-txt/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Building a high-performance Python module for browser emulation research that accurately replicates Chrome's networking behavior, supporting 10,000+ concurrent connections for testing Cloudflare-protected infrastructure. The module provides async/await architecture with zero blocking operations, enabling researchers to conduct legitimate testing with full browser fingerprinting.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+
**Primary Dependencies**: aiohttp>=3.9.0, tls-client>=1.0.0, httpx[http2]>=0.25.0, uvloop>=0.19.0, quickjs>=1.0.0
**Storage**: N/A (stateless operation)
**Testing**: pytest, pytest-asyncio
**Target Platform**: Linux/Windows/macOS servers
**Project Type**: single (Python module/library)
**Performance Goals**: 10,000+ concurrent requests, <10ms challenge detection overhead, 99.9% success rate
**Constraints**: <100MB memory per 1000 requests, automatic backpressure at 80% resource utilization
**Scale/Scope**: Production-grade module handling thousands of concurrent research requests

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Since the constitution template is not customized, applying default principles:
- ✅ Library-First: Building as standalone Python module
- ✅ CLI Interface: Module will expose CLI for testing
- ✅ Test-First: TDD approach with failing tests before implementation
- ✅ Integration Testing: Contract tests for all endpoints
- ✅ Simplicity: Starting with core functionality, avoiding premature optimization

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 (Single project) - Python module/library structure

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - TLS fingerprinting implementation approaches
   - Chrome browser emulation accuracy requirements
   - Async concurrency patterns for 10k+ connections
   - Challenge detection and solving strategies

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   Task: "Research TLS fingerprinting libraries for Chrome emulation"
   Task: "Find best practices for high-concurrency async Python"
   Task: "Research Cloudflare challenge types and detection patterns"
   Task: "Evaluate JavaScript engines for Python integration"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Test Request: Single browser emulation request with timing and config
   - Test Session: Collection of requests with shared configuration
   - Challenge Record: Information about security challenges encountered
   - Performance Metrics: Timing, throughput, and resource measurements
   - Test Configuration: Browser emulation behavior settings

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - REST API contract: `/contracts/cloudflare_bypass_api.yaml`
   - Python module interface: `/contracts/python_module_interface.py`
   - Core operations: GET/POST requests, batch processing, session management
   - Challenge handling: Detection, solving, cookie management
   - Metrics export: JSON/CSV formats for analysis

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - Contract tests will be generated in Phase 2 (/tasks command)
   - Tests must validate all API endpoints and module interfaces
   - Performance contract tests for concurrency and timing requirements

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Chrome browser emulation validation
   - High-concurrency load testing (10,000+ requests)
   - Challenge detection and solving workflows
   - Data export and metrics collection
   - Resource management and backpressure handling

5. **Agent context file update**:
   - CLAUDE.md updated with current tech stack and patterns
   - Focus on async/await, curl_cffi, and PyMiniRacer integration
   - Performance optimization patterns for high concurrency

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, quickstart.md scenarios, CLAUDE.md update

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base template
- Generate implementation tasks from Phase 1 design artifacts
- Core module structure: CloudflareBYpass class, TLS client, HTTP client
- Challenge system: Detector, JavaScript solver, Turnstile handler
- Performance components: Concurrency management, metrics collection
- Testing infrastructure: Unit tests, integration tests, performance benchmarks

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Contract tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Core HTTP client → TLS integration → Challenge handling → Performance optimization
- Module structure: Base classes → Specialized components → Integration layer
- Mark [P] for parallel execution where components are independent

**Key Task Categories**:
1. **Foundation Tasks** [P]: Project structure, dependencies, base classes
2. **Core HTTP Client**: Async client with curl_cffi integration
3. **TLS Fingerprinting**: Chrome emulation with proper cipher suites
4. **Challenge System**: Detection, JavaScript execution, cookie management
5. **Concurrency Layer**: Semaphore control, backpressure, resource monitoring
6. **Testing Suite**: Contract validation, performance benchmarks, integration tests
7. **Documentation**: API docs, usage examples, performance guides

**Estimated Output**: 35-40 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md with clear dependencies

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

No constitutional violations identified - all principles align with the design approach.

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*
