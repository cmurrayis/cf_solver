# Python Module Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Module Structure
Every Python module must have a clear, documented structure with proper package organization and entry points defined in setup.py or pyproject.toml.

### II. Testing Requirements
All modules must include unit tests with minimum 80% code coverage using pytest or unittest framework.

### III. Documentation
Every module must include README.md with installation instructions, basic usage examples, and API documentation.

### IV. Dependencies
Minimize external dependencies; clearly specify requirements in requirements.txt or pyproject.toml with version pinning.

### V. Error Handling
Implement proper exception handling with custom exceptions for domain-specific errors and meaningful error messages.

## Code Quality Standards

Python modules must follow PEP 8 style guidelines, include type hints for all public functions, and use proper logging instead of print statements.

## Distribution Requirements

Modules must be installable via pip with proper versioning following semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).

## Governance

This constitution defines the minimum viable requirements for Python modules. All code must pass linting (flake8/black) and type checking (mypy) before deployment.
